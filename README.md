# linux_interview_simulations
A collection of ChatGPT generated (and human edited) scripts and things to simulate common technical interview scenarios in Linux

note: this is a brand new WIP as of May 2024 so I would advise against running any of it until I have finished!

Simulation 5: Finding and replacing strings in a file on server
- simulation_5.sh will create a file named user_data.csv in your current working directory. 
- use awk or sed to find all instances of the string "hello" and replace it with another 5 character string
- use awk to replace the letter "B" with "Q" in column 2
- now repeat those two steps using sed instead of awk
- make sure you're actually writing back to the file, not just to stout!
